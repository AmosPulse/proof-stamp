## Project Board Columns Missing ⚠️
The 404 errors you saw are because your GitHub project board needs columns created.

2. **Create these 4 columns** (in order):
   - **To Do** 
   - **In Progress**
   - **Review** 
   - **Done**

## What Each Column Means
- **To Do**: New tasks ready to start (15 issues)
- **In Progress**: Active work by agents (3 critical issues)
- **Review**: Completed work awaiting approval  
- **Done**: Finished tasks

## Current Issue Distribution
- **#109, #112, #115**: In Progress (critical priority)
- **#110, #111, #113, #114, #116, #118**: To Do (high priority)
